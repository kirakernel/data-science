# Types of databases
## SQL databases
There are many different types of SQL databases designed for different purposes. In this course, we will use [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) within the classroom, which is a popular open-source database with a very complete library of analytical functions. (Note: You do not need to install PostgreSQL on your computer unless you really want to. We provide SQL environments in the classroom for you to work in.)

Some of the most popular databases include:

- MySQL
- Access
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Postgres

> You can also write SQL within other programming frameworks like Python, Scala, and Hadoop.

## Smal differences
Each of these SQL databases may have subtle differences in syntax and available functions -- for example, **MySQL doesnâ€™t** have some of the functions for modifying dates as **Postgres**. Most of what you see with Postgres will be directly applicable to using SQL in other frameworks and database environments. For the differences that do exist, you should check the documentation. Most SQL environments have great documentation online that you can easily access with a quick Google search.

> The _article_ [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems) compares three of the most common types of SQL: *SQLite*, *PostgreSQL*, and *MySQL*. Again, once you have learned how to write SQL in one environment, the skills are mostly transferable.
